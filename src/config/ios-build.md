# iOS Build Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Mac with Xcode installed
2. Apple Developer Account (for App Store deployment)
3. Git repository with project code

## Build Steps

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone the project
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd doula-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the web assets
npm run build
```

### 2. Add iOS Platform
```bash
# Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios

# Update iOS dependencies
npx cap update ios

# Sync web assets to iOS
npx cap sync ios
```

### 3. Configure App Icons & Splash Screens
The following assets are automatically configured:
- App Icon: `public/icon-1024.png` (1024x1024)
- Splash Screen: `public/splash-2732x2732.png`

Additional icon sizes will be generated by Xcode automatically.

### 4. Open in Xcode
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

### 5. Configure in Xcode
1. **Bundle Identifier**: Set to `app.lovable.2faf8997ab00482fa5d99b3238ceda15`
2. **Display Name**: "Doula Care"
3. **Permissions**: Camera and Photo Library access are pre-configured
4. **Signing**: Configure your Apple Developer Team
5. **Deployment Target**: iOS 13.0 or later

### 6. Test on Simulator/Device
```bash
# Run on iOS simulator
npx cap run ios

# Or open in Xcode and run manually
```

### 7. Build for Production
In Xcode:
1. Select "Generic iOS Device" or your physical device
2. Product → Archive
3. Follow App Store Connect upload process

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
2. **Sync Issues**: Run `npx cap sync ios` after code changes
3. **Permission Errors**: Check Info.plist for camera/storage permissions

### Update Process
After making changes to web code:
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync ios
```
