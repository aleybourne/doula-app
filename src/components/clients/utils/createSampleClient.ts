 * CLIENT STATUS vs BIRTH STAGE CLARIFICATION:
 * 
 * status: "active" | "past" 
 * - Controls whether client appears in your active client list
 * - "active" = currently working with this client
 * - "past" = no longer working with this client (archived)
 * 
 * birthStage: "pregnant" | "active-labor" | "delivered"
 * - Tracks pregnancy/birth progress for active clients
 * - Used for dashboard stats and client progress tracking
 * - Independent of client management status
